    "- Assign a variable to the maximum number of games: 1, 3, 5, etc...\n",
    "- This time the previously defined function is used\n",
    "- Assign a variable to the number of games a player must win to win. Preferably the value will be based on the number of maximum games.\n",
    "- Define a function that randomly returns one of the 5 options. This will correspond to the play of the machine. Totally random.\n",
    "- Define a function that asks for your choice among the 5 must only allow one of the 5 options. This is defensive programming. If it is not valid, keep asking until it is.\n",
    "- Define a function that resolves a combat.\n",
    "- Returns 0 if there is a tie, 1 if the machine wins, 2 if the human player wins.\n",
    "- Define a function that shows the choice of each player and the state of the game\n",
    "- This function must be used every time the accumulated points are updated\n",
    "- Create two variables that accumulate the games won by each participant\n",
    "- Create a loop that iterates as long as no player reaches the win minimum necessary to win. Inside the loop resolve the move of the machine and asks the player's.\n",
    "- Compare them and update the value of the variables\n",
    "- Accumulate the games won by each participant.\n",
    "- Announce by console the winner of the game based on who has the most wins accumulated."
